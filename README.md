   cd famlyportal
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # or
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Copy template and configure
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

5. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Budget Allocation Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Setup budget allocation for all families
   python manage.py setup_budget_allocation
   
   # Or setup for specific family
   python manage.py setup_budget_allocation --family-id 1
   ```

7. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Budget Allocation Management

### Setup Commands
```bash

## Development Guidelines

### Project Architecture
- **Family-Centric Design** - All data scoped to families with complete isolation
- **Role-Based Security** - Granular permissions with app-level access control
